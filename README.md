# JBCA Data Science Hack Night December 2017

Welcome to the 3rd JBCA Data Science Hack Night.
For this hack night, each team will choose one of the following challenges and present a 3 minute presentation.
These presentations will be judged by the organisers and the winners will win the coveted Data Monkey Trophy and othr prizes! This month's JBCA Hack Night is sponsored (food and prizes) by the Technology Recruitment Solutions Provider, [Cathcart Associates](http://www.cathcartassociates.com/) 

The presentations will be judged on the accuracy of the predicted results via machine learning and visualisation/presentation 
of the data/results.

## Schedule

18.00 - 18.20: Welcome presentation

18.20 - 18.30: Forming teams

18.30 - 19.15: **first half**

19.15 - 19.30: Pizza!

19.30 - 20.30: **second half**

20.30 - 20.50: Lightning presentations from teams

20.50 - 21.00: Judging and prizes


## The challenges

Below we've described three different challenges for which each team will pick one to work on.


### Challenge 1: Machine learning - Mucis Machine Learning.

### Challenge 2: Build a Machine Learning web application

Machine Learning can be used to provide awesome applications and services. Examples are recommender systems on Netflix, Amazon and even Google reverse Image search. However, creating an application isn't limited to big tech firms. In this challenge you will build a web application of your choice. It can either be a ML project you have worked on previously or one of the challenges from this or previous hack nights. 

In the folder web_app, a setp-by-step example on creating a web application from a Python/scikit-learn project. The project I have used in the movie recommender challenge from the [October Hack night](https://github.com/hrampadarath/JBCA_HackNight_Oct17). 

You can view and use the final webapplication at https://movie-recommender-example.herokuapp.com/

### Challenge 3: Google Image webscraping and classification
In this challenge you will learn how to web scrape images from Google and use it to train/test a Machone Leaning model. The aim is to come up with a image classification problem (cats vs dogs, people vs trees, Trump vs an orange cheeto etc), web srape the images and then use ML for the classification.
